This dataset contains records of forest fires, including details such as the month, day, location (X, Y), temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, rainfall, and the area burned using 

Microsoft Excel, SQL and Power BI.

# Report Objectives
Identify the top two fires with the largest burned area to highlight the most severe incidents in the dataset.

Determine the frequency of fires by month to understand seasonal fire trends.

Calculate the total burned area by month to assess which periods caused the most damage.

Find the month with the highest average fire size to detect months with larger but possibly fewer fires.

Identify the region with the highest fire frequency to locate geographic hotspots of fire activity.

Highlight the fire(s) with the largest burned area to understand extreme events.

Analyze the average temperature and relative humidity by region to examine environmental conditions linked to fire occurrence.
